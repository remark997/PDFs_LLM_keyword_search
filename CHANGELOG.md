## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-07

### üêõ Fixed

- **Word Boundary Matching**: Fixed critical bug where keywords would match partial words
  - Example: Searching for "tree" would incorrectly match "street", "trees", etc.
  - Solution: Added regex word boundary (`\b`) to ensure exact word matching
  - Affected functions: `search_keywords_in_text()`, `generate_markdown_report()`

- **PDF Document Closed Error**: Fixed "document closed" error during PDF processing
  - Issue: Document was being closed before accessing its properties
  - Solution: Store page count before processing, added proper try-finally blocks
  - Improved: Page-level error handling to prevent complete failure

- **Windows Console Encoding**: Fixed UnicodeEncodeError on Windows systems
  - Issue: Emoji characters (üîß, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå) couldn't be displayed in Windows console

  - Impact: Full Windows compatibility restored

## Release Notes

### Version Numbering

We follow Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):
- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backward compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backward compatible)

### Upgrade Instructions

#### From 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

1. **Update your code**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **No breaking changes**: All existing code should work without modification

3. **Note**: Keywords now match exact words only (word boundary matching)
   - This is a behavioral change but improves accuracy
   - Previous partial matches will no longer appear in results

### Known Issues

- Large PDF files (>500 pages) may take significant time with OCR enabled
- Gemini API rate limits may cause delays during heavy usage
- Local OCR models require significant disk space (2-3GB)

### Future Plans

See the [Roadmap](README.md#-roadmap) section in README.md for upcoming features.
